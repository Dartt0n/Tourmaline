# Tourmaline
## Idea
I decided to spend December configuring and building my own Linux workspace

## Goals
- Working Setup
- Comfortable Keyboard mappings
- Configured editors
- Automatic startups, connections etc.
- Backups
- A lot of cloud communication
  - time sync
  - weather sync
  - cloud builds
  - dockers


## Results
It's 30th of December and it's time to make a summary.
It was a difficult month because of the many exams I took and heavy workload at work.
Nevertheless, I managed to achieve some goals for this month and for this project.
So... Here we go.

By the time of 30th December I have
- working setup
- configured ubuntu server
- comfortable hotkeys and keyboard mapping
- configured editors (Nvim and VScode)
- cloud-based development setup
- time sync
- weather sync
- remote dockers
- self-hosted sites

Now I'm working on saving all my configs and I think I'll give a try to `Pop_OS` next month.
